Below is a plug-and-play packaging + CTA + gating playbook tailored to what RealtorsDashboard already does (Opportunity Screener / Market Explorer, “Generate Deal Memo”, “Report PDF”, daily-updated NY/NJ/CT data, and API access).  ￼

⸻

1) Packaging & pricing (keep Pro as-is; add Premium above it)

You already anchor Pro at $29/mo or $290/yr and position it as “unlimited access + API + AI deal memos”. Don’t take those away—add Premium as new power features.  ￼

Plans

Free — $0
Pro — $29/mo or $290/yr (existing)  ￼
Premium — $79/mo or $790/yr (new)
Team/Brokerage — “Contact” (optional, but great for upsell later)

What’s “new” in Premium (so it’s defensible)

Premium should unlock things Pro doesn’t currently promise:
	•	Alerts & monitoring: watchlist alerts (price change / opportunity score change / new comps), daily/weekly digests
	•	Portfolio & reporting: multi-property portfolio view, branded client reports, bulk PDF generation
	•	Bulk workflows: batch screening, CSV export, saved filters/templates
	•	Bigger API: keep Pro at the published quota (10k/day, 10 rps burst). Premium increases that (example: 100k/day, 50 rps).  ￼
	•	Priority: faster support + early access to new states (“More states coming soon”).  ￼

⸻

2) Gating structure (exact rules to implement)

You have SEO traffic landing on property pages and discovery pages (Opportunity Screener). The gating should convert without blocking Google.

A. Anonymous visitor (no login)

Show enough to feel valuable, but not enough to “finish the job”:
	•	Show: headline metrics + Opportunity Score + “vs median” teaser + a preview of comps count  ￼
	•	Lock behind blur:
	•	Full Comps table
	•	Investment Signals
	•	AI section
	•	Generate Deal Memo
	•	Report PDF  ￼

Trigger paywall when they click: “Generate Deal Memo” / “Report PDF” / “Full Comps”.

B. Free account (email captured)

Give a small “aha” so they trust the model:
	•	Allow per day:
	•	5 Market/Opportunity searches
	•	3 full property unlocks/day (full comps + score breakdown)
	•	1 watermarked PDF/week (“Sample / Free” watermark)
	•	Always locked:
	•	Bulk exports
	•	Alerts
	•	API

C. Pro
	•	Unlimited Market Explorer + Opportunity Screener usage
	•	Unlimited property unlocks
	•	Deal Memo + PDF exports
	•	API at published quota (10k/day, 10 rps burst)  ￼

D. Premium
	•	Everything in Pro
	•	Alerts/digests + portfolio + bulk exports
	•	Higher API quota + priority support

3) CTA placement playbook (what to add where)

Global header (all pages)

Primary button: “Start free”
Secondary link: “View pricing”

Homepage hero

Primary CTA: “Start free”
Secondary CTA: “See Opportunity Screener” (deep link to /investment-opportunities)  ￼

Property detail pages (your #1 SEO money page)

Add a sticky right-rail card (desktop) / sticky bottom bar (mobile):
	•	Primary: “Generate Deal Memo (Pro)”
	•	Secondary: “Unlock Full Comps”
	•	Micro-trust line: “Currently NY/NJ/CT • Data updated daily”  ￼

Opportunity Screener results
	•	Above results: “Save this search” (Free)
	•	On export / sorting filters: Upgrade prompt (Pro)
	•	On alerts: Upgrade prompt (Premium)

⸻

4) Exact copy to paste (homepage, property pages, pricing, paywalls)

A) Homepage hero (paste)

5) The “conversion loop” you should implement (in order)
	1.	Email capture on first high-intent click (“Deal Memo” or “Report PDF”).
	2.	Immediately show a limited free preview (1 section) so it feels real.
	3.	Upsell to Pro to remove friction (“unlimited + exports + API”).  ￼
	4.	Upsell to Premium only when they try: alerts, bulk export, portfolio, higher API.

If you tell me which page gets the most SEO landings (Property pages vs Opportunity Screener vs API), I’ll tailor the exact paywall triggers/quotas to maximize Pro conversions first and Premium second.
