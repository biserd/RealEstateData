Below is a consolidated Business Requirements Document (BRD) for a Tri-State Real Estate Opportunity SaaS focused on NY (incl. Long Island) + NJ + CT with a strong, auditable data foundation and “grounded AI” that blends traditional + alternative data sources.

⸻

BRD — Tri-State Real Estate Market Intelligence & Opportunity Engine (NY/NJ/CT)

1) Purpose

Build a subscription SaaS that helps buyers, investors, and agents identify opportunities and understand pricing by ZIP code, city, neighborhood, and property segment (type, beds/baths, year-built bands, size). The platform must provide robust market baselines (e.g., price per square foot distributions) and produce explainable opportunity scoring supported by verifiable data.

2) Objectives & Success Criteria

Business Objectives
	•	Launch a sellable product focused on NY with immediate utility in NYC + Long Island, and credible coverage for NJ + CT from day 1.
	•	Deliver “cheap vs expensive” clarity and a ranked list of opportunities with confidence and evidence.

Success Criteria (MVP)
	•	Users can select a ZIP/city/neighborhood and instantly see pricing bands (p25/p50/p75) for relevant segments.
	•	Users can view a property and receive:
	•	expected price range
	•	comps
	•	opportunity score
	•	explanation + data citations
	•	“Deep coverage” in NYC; “market intelligence coverage” across NY/NJ/CT; expansion via coverage matrix.

KPI Targets (examples)
	•	Conversion: 3–8% from free trial → paid
	•	Retention: 60%+ month-2 retention (early)
	•	Time-to-insight: < 2 seconds for market pages (cached aggregates)
	•	Data reliability: key-field completeness > 85% in deep coverage areas (sqft, year, last sale)

⸻

3) In Scope (MVP)

Geography
	•	New York: NYC + Long Island (Nassau/Suffolk) + Hudson Valley + rest of NY
	•	New Jersey: statewide “market intelligence” coverage
	•	Connecticut: statewide “market intelligence” coverage

Primary User Personas
	•	Retail buyers/sellers (power users)
	•	Small/medium investors (1–50 doors)
	•	Agents / agent-investors
	•	Analysts / researchers

Core Use Cases
	1.	Market Pricing Coach
	•	“Is ZIP X expensive for 3/2 SFH built 1990–2010?”
	2.	Opportunity Screener
	•	“Show underpriced homes with low risk and strong liquidity.”
	3.	Property Drill-Down
	•	“Show comps and explain why this is a deal (or not).”
	4.	Neighborhood/Block Insight (NYC deep)
	•	Distress/capex signals (permits, violations, complaints) integrated into scoring.
	5.	Watchlists + Alerts
	•	notify when opportunity score crosses threshold, price cuts, new sales comps, etc.

⸻

4) Out of Scope (MVP)
	•	Full MLS/IDX browsing portal replacement
	•	Real-time underwriting (mortgage quotes, hard credit models)
	•	Automated offer generation / transaction execution
	•	Property management features

⸻

5) Product Principles
	•	Data-first: computed metrics drive the UI; AI explains them.
	•	Grounded AI: no unsupported claims; always show evidence and confidence.
	•	Cost-controlled: minimize variable costs via precomputation + caching; meter expensive calls.
	•	Tiered coverage: market intelligence everywhere; deep property insights where data is strongest.

⸻

6) Data Requirements

6.1 Required Data Domains

A) Property Facts (parcel/building attributes)
	•	address, lat/lon, property type/class, beds, baths, living area sqft, lot size, year built, HOA/condo metadata (if available)

B) Sales / Transactions
	•	sale price, sale date, arms-length indicator (if known), deed/transfer metadata (if available)

C) Listings / Active Market (optional MVP, recommended soon)
	•	list price, list date, days on market, price cuts, status changes
(If not available initially, MVP can still function using transactions + valuation proxies. Listings become a paid add-on or phase 2.)

D) Market Aggregates (must be computed by you)
	•	ZIP/city/neighborhood distributions for:
	•	$/sqft and price
	•	by property type (SFH/condo/townhome/multi-family)
	•	by beds/baths bands
	•	by year-built bands (e.g., pre-1940, 1940–69, 1970–89, 1990–2009, 2010+)
	•	by size bands
	•	volume metrics: transaction count, turnover, volatility proxy

E) Alternative Data (priority: NYC; scalable to NJ/CT as sources permit)
	•	construction/permit activity (capex and renovation signal)
	•	building distress (violations)
	•	quality-of-life complaints (e.g., civic request data)
	•	transit accessibility and amenity density (open map data)
	•	flood risk & climate hazard overlays
	•	demographic/economic context (ACS-like)

6.2 Coverage Matrix (Required)

Maintain a coverage_matrix by geography (state/county/ZIP) that governs:
	•	coverage_level: MarketOnly | PropertyFacts | SalesHistory | Listings | Comps | AltSignals
	•	freshness_sla_days
	•	field_completeness for key attributes
	•	confidence_score
	•	allowed_ai_claims (what the AI is permitted to say)

This is non-negotiable for trust and for NY/NJ/CT mixed data maturity.

6.3 “Minimum Payments” Strategy (Required)
	•	Use public/low-cost sources + your own aggregates for 80–90% of views.
	•	Paid sources (if used) must be behind meter points:
	•	property deep dive
	•	comps retrieval
	•	export report generation
	•	alert refresh
	•	Hard quotas per plan + caching keyed by (property_id, last_updated).

⸻

8) Analytics & Scoring Requirements

8.1 Market Segmentation Grid (Required)

Define a standard segmentation taxonomy:
	•	property_type: SFH, Condo, Townhome, Multi-family (2–4), 5+
	•	beds_band: 0–1, 2, 3, 4, 5+
	•	baths_band: 1, 2, 3+

	•	supporting evidence list (comps + dataset references)

8.3 Expected Price Model (v1 required)
	•	Start with a simple hedonic model using:
	•	sqft, beds, baths, year built, type, location encoding, lot size (if applicable)
	•	Must output:
	•	expected value range (e.g., 10th–90th)
	•	model confidence (based on training density in that segment and comp similarity)
	•	Must degrade gracefully in thin-data areas (use segment medians and wide intervals)

⸻

9) AI Requirements (Grounded + Safe)

9.1 Grounded Response Policy (Required)

AI may only generate outputs based on:
	•	computed aggregates in your DB
	•	retrieved comps + property facts
	•	feature store values
	•	approved public datasets stored in your catalog

AI must never:
	•	invent comps or values
	•	claim certainty when coverage/confidence is low
	•	provide steering/discriminatory guidance

9.2 AI Capabilities
	•	“Ask the Market” chat for a geography
	•	“Explain this score” for a property
	•	“Compare these two ZIPs” (NY/NJ/CT)
	•	“Find datasets to improve coverage” (internal agent)

9.3 AI Output Format (Required)
	•	Default to structured JSON internally:
	•	answer_summary
	•	key_numbers (with units)
	•	evidence (comps IDs, datasets IDs)
	•	confidence and limitations
	•	Render into human-friendly UI with citations and badges.

9.4 Fair Housing & Compliance Guardrails (Required)
	•	Prohibit prompts/answers that rank areas based on protected classes or “avoid X people” logic.
	•	If user asks for disallowed content, AI responds with safe alternative framing (“Here are objective market metrics: pricing, schools availability as public data, commute, amenities…”).

⸻

10) Non-Functional Requirements

Performance
	•	Market Explorer pages: <2s (served from aggregates cache)
	•	Property deep dives: <5–8s (allowed to run comps retrieval + model)
	•	Alerts batch run: schedule daily/hourly depending on plan

Reliability
	•	99.5% uptime MVP target
	•	ETL retries and backfills
	•	Immutable audit logs for data refresh

Security
	•	OAuth/email auth, MFA optional
	•	Role-based access (user/admin)
	•	Encrypt at rest, TLS in transit
	•	Rate limits + abuse prevention

Privacy / Legal
	•	Respect dataset licenses/terms; store license metadata in Data Catalog
	•	Provide disclaimers: informational tool, not appraisal/financial advice
	•	Logging policy and data retention rules

⸻

11) Architecture Requirements (recommended reference implementation)

Data Layer
	•	Postgres + PostGIS (canonical store)
	•	Object storage for raw dumps (S3-compatible)
	•	Vector store (for dataset docs + explanations), optional

ETL/Orchestration
	•	Prefect or Airflow
	•	Daily/weekly jobs for aggregates; streaming optional later

Services
	•	API: FastAPI/Node
	•	Search: Elasticsearch/OpenSearch (geo + full-text)
	•	Compute: background workers for scoring, comps, alerts

Caching
	•	Redis for hot ZIP/city stats + property deep-dive cache

Observability
	•	ETL dashboards, data quality checks, anomaly detection on prices/sqft outliers

⸻

12) UX Requirements (MVP screens)
	1.	Landing + onboarding (select NY/NJ/CT interests)
	2.	Market Explorer (ZIP/city/neighborhood)
	3.	Opportunity Screener (ranked list + filters)
	4.	Property Detail (facts + comps + score + AI)
	5.	Watchlists & Alerts
	6.	Reports/Exports
	7.	Admin Console (data catalog + coverage matrix + ETL health)

⸻

13) Rollout Plan (Tri-State)

Phase 1 (NYC deep + tri-state market intelligence)
	•	NYC: property-level scoring + alt signals
	•	NYS/NJ/CT: Market Explorer + risk/rent/trend overlays + limited property drilldown where facts exist

Phase 2 (Long Island + selected NJ/CT counties deepening)
	•	Expand deep coverage county-by-county based on:
	•	sales data availability
	•	sqft/year-built completeness
	•	refresh cadence stability

Phase 3 (Full tri-state deep where feasible)
	•	Listings integration (if desired)
	•	ML ranking improvements from user feedback/closed loops

⸻

14) Key Risks & Mitigations
	•	Sales data gaps outside NYC → coverage matrix + paid data only for drilldowns/exports + county-by-county enablement
	•	Inconsistent sqft/year-built → data validation, imputation rules, confidence downgrades
	•	Licensing constraints → maintain Data Catalog; restrict redistribution; use derived aggregates where needed
	•	AI hallucinations → grounded tool-only responses + citations + low-confidence safe mode

⸻

15) Deliverables for the Build Agent
	1.	Database schema (property_fact, sale_txn, zip_market_stats, feature_store, comps, coverage_matrix, data_catalog)
	2.	ETL jobs (NYC + NYS parcels + overlays + aggregates)
	3.	Scoring service (Opportunity Score v1 + expected value model v1)
	4.	API endpoints + auth + rate limits
	5.	Frontend screens (7 MVP screens)
	6.	Grounded AI service (RAG/tooling + structured outputs)
	7.	Monitoring + admin console

⸻

If you want, I can also generate a developer-ready task breakdown (epics → stories) and the exact field lists for each table (including index strategy, geo keys, and a starter segmentation grid for NYC vs suburban counties).
