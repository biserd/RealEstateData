That’s totally normal at this stage — most real-estate apps start “building-first.” The key is to **make units a first-class entity in the UI + routing + search**, without breaking your existing building pages.

Here’s the clean path.

## 1) Decide what each page *is* (entity types)

You now have two NYC condo layers:

* **Building entity** (baseBbl): `/building/:baseBbl`
* **Unit entity** (unitBbl): `/unit/:unitBbl`

If your “property detail” route still points to buildings, that’s why everything feels building-based.

✅ Next step: make the **global search** and **opportunity cards** return a mix of building + unit results, each with a link to the correct route.

## 2) Make the search bar return both Buildings + Units

### UX

Add a pill toggle:

* **All** (default)
* **Buildings**
* **Units**

### Response shape (simple)

Return results like:

```json
{
  "type": "unit",
  "unitBbl": "1012345678",
  "baseBbl": "1012340003",
  "title": "52 E 72 St — Unit 12B",
  "subtitle": "Upper East Side • Manhattan",
  "href": "/unit/1012345678"
}
```

and

```json
{
  "type": "building",
  "baseBbl": "1012340003",
  "title": "52 E 72 St",
  "subtitle": "Condo building • 212 residential units",
  "href": "/building/1012340003"
}
```

---

## 3) Update “Opportunity Screener” to be **unit-first** (NYC condo investing is unit-level)

Right now, if opportunities are building-level, you’ll miss the actual deals.

### Minimal change

* Keep building opportunities for multifamily / 1–4 family
* For condos, generate opportunities at the **unit** level:

  * underpriced vs building median unit sales
  * underpriced vs last sale (repeat-sale delta)

Each card must link to:

* condos → `/unit/:unitBbl`
* non-condo lots → `/property/:bbl` or `/building/:baseBbl`

---

## 4) Put “Unit picker” on building pages

Your building page can remain the entry point, but it must route users into units:

* Default tab: **Units**
* Click a row → `/unit/:unitBbl`
* Add quick filters: bedrooms (later), unit type, “has recent sale”

This turns building pages into a directory instead of the “main object.”

---

## 5) Add a unit-aware “Property Detail” resolver (so old links still work)

If you have a generic route like `/property/:id`, make it resolve:

* if `id` matches a unitBbl → redirect to `/unit/:unitBbl`
* else if matches baseBbl/building → redirect to `/building/:baseBbl`
* else show your existing building/lot page

This prevents breaking anything and makes the system feel coherent.

---

## 6) What to build next (given your screenshot sections)

The best next feature once units are surfaced:

### **Unit-level Comps + “Why it’s underpriced”**

Because it powers:

* Opportunity Screener credibility
* Unit detail page usefulness
* Market Explorer “median” accuracy (condos should use unit sales, not building aggregates)

---

### Quick self-check: are you truly “building-only” right now?

You are if:

* search results link to `/building/...` even when the query clearly includes “Unit 12B”
* opportunity cards show one item per building, not per unit
* your “property details” are keyed by `baseBbl` only

If you want, paste one sample search API response + one opportunity card payload and I’ll tell you exactly where to switch to unit routing and which pages should stay building-first.
