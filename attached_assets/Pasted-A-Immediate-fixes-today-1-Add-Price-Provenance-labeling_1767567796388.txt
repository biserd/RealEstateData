A. Immediate fixes (today)
1) Add “Price Provenance” labeling everywhere (search results, cards, detail headers)

Every card must show:

Sale Price (recorded) — if you have a real transaction

Estimated Value — if it’s modeled/derived (sqft × $/sqft)

Assessed Value — if it’s from assessment (if you have it)

And a tiny tag:

Verified (transactions)

Estimated (model)

Assessed (tax)

This single change eliminates most confusion.

3) Add a badge on cards (non-negotiable)

On each card and detail page:

PRICE: VERIFIED or PRICE: ESTIMATED

Also show the formula if estimated:

“Estimated = sqft × neighborhood $/sqft (not a recorded sale)”

B. Product structure (next)
Make “Opportunity Screener” use verified data by default

This is the trust layer.

Default mode: Verified Opportunities

Source: condo units with recorded sales (your unit_sales)

Score is meaningful here

Secondary mode: Estimated Opportunities

Source: PLUTO properties with estimated values

Different score name: don’t call it “deal score”

call it “Value Gap (Estimated)” or “Model Discount”

Requires a visible toggle + warning

This way you keep the Properties tab useful without pretending it’s deal-grade.

C. Should Units be the default? (yes, but do it tactfully)
2) Set Units as default for Opportunity Screener, not for the whole app (yet)

The best compromise:

Opportunity Screener default = Verified (Units)

Market Explorer can remain market-wide

Properties tab remains accessible as “Buildings (Estimated)”

Later, if users overwhelmingly prefer units, you can make global default “All” with Units ranked first.

D. Rename tabs to match reality (big UX win)

Instead of:

Properties

Condo Units

Use:

Buildings (Estimated)

Units (Verified Sales)

People instantly understand.

E. Implementation details (simple and robust)

Add fields to every search result payload:

entity_type: building | unit

price_value

price_kind: sale | estimate | assessed | none

price_confidence: verified | modeled | admin

price_as_of (date)

Then UI rendering is deterministic.
